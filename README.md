# Robin Triviabot: THE NEUTRALIZER

Neutralizes an obnoxious trivia bot (by /u/npinsker) for use with reddit's robin chat channels.

## WARNING

This code is garbage. I just took the original source and shoehorned my own logic in.

(However, because Robin will last only for like 3 more days, I have zero guilt.)

## Installation for pitiful Chrome plebians

1. Install Tampermonkey. (http://tampermonkey.net)

2. Click this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crustysock/robin_triviabot/master/questions_bot_gm.js
(It should either install automatically, or if not copy/paste the code into a new Tampermonkey extension.)

3. Grow up and install Firefox

You can view the source code at https://github.com/crustysock/robin_triviabot (originally https://github.com/npinsker/robin_triviabot)

## Simple usage commands

- Set 'mute = true' or 'mute = false' in the command line to turn off/on bot posting.
- Set 'trivia_type_flag = FLAG_STANDARD' in the command line to enable contest mode!
  (The bot will return to free play mode after the contest concludes.)
